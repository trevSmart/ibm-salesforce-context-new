# JavaScript Obfuscation Breaking the Server (Fixed)

## Issue Description

When running `npm run publish-package`, the JavaScript obfuscation process was causing the server to fail with a reference error:

```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a0_0x425f5a' before initialization
 ❯ createModuleLogger src/lib/logger.js:1:6449
 ❯ src/lib/OrgWatcher.js:1:3578
 ❯ src/mcp-server.js:1:1060
```

All 26 test suites failed after obfuscation, even though the tests passed before obfuscation.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **circular dependency** between `mcp-server.js` and `lib/logger.js`:

1. `mcp-server.js` imports `createModuleLogger` from `lib/logger.js`
2. `lib/logger.js` imports `state` from `mcp-server.js`

When JavaScript obfuscation tools process circular dependencies, they can create initialization order issues that result in "Cannot access before initialization" errors. The obfuscator rearranges and transforms code in ways that expose the circular dependency problem.

## Solution

The circular dependency was broken by extracting the `state` object into its own module:

1. **Created `src/state.js`**: A new module that exports only the state object
2. **Updated `src/mcp-server.js`**: Changed to import state from `state.js` and re-export it for backward compatibility
3. **Updated `src/lib/logger.js`**: Changed to import state from `state.js` instead of `mcp-server.js`
4. **Updated all other modules**: Changed imports of `state` from `mcp-server.js` to `state.js`

### Dependency Graph Before Fix

```
mcp-server.js → logger.js → mcp-server.js (CIRCULAR!)
```

### Dependency Graph After Fix

```
state.js ← mcp-server.js
      ↑
      └─ logger.js
```

## Files Changed

- **New file**: `src/state.js` - Contains the state object
- **Modified**: `src/mcp-server.js` - Imports and re-exports state
- **Modified**: `src/lib/logger.js` - Imports state from new module
- **Modified**: 12 other files in `src/tools/` and `src/lib/` - Updated imports

## Testing

The fix was verified with:

1. ✅ Linting passes: `npm run lint:fix`
2. ✅ Server starts correctly without obfuscation
3. ✅ Server starts correctly with obfuscated code
4. ✅ All tests pass with the same results as before
5. ✅ CLI commands work correctly (`--version`, `--help`)
6. ✅ Comprehensive obfuscation test with full publish script settings

## Why This Fix Works

By moving `state` to its own module:
- Both `mcp-server.js` and `logger.js` can import it without creating a cycle
- JavaScript module loading can properly initialize all modules in order
- Obfuscation tools can correctly analyze and transform the dependency graph
- The code remains modular and maintainable

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar circular dependency issues:
1. Keep shared state in separate modules
2. Use `madge` or similar tools to detect circular dependencies
3. Run obfuscation tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline
4. Document module dependencies for critical files
