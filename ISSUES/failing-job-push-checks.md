### Issue: Track Failing Job 'Push checks'

The job 'Push checks' has failed due to the `getSetupAuditTrail` tool returning undefined or missing expected fields in its result. This has caused assertions like:

- `expect(result?.structuredContent?.filters).toBeTruthy()` 
- `expect(Array.isArray(result.structuredContent.records)).toBe(true)`  

These assertions are failing in the file `test/tools/getSetupAuditTrail.test.js`, indicating that `result.structuredContent` or its `records` property is undefined.

#### Suggested Action:
Update the handler to always return the expected `structuredContent` shape, even on error. This will help prevent such failures in the future.

#### Reference:
- Job logs for details on the failure.
- Test code in `getSetupAuditTrail.test.js` for context.
