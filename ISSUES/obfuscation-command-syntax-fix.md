# Obfuscation Command Syntax Error (Fixed)

## Issue Description

When running `npm run publish-package`, the JavaScript obfuscation process was failing with:

```
❌ Error obfuscating dist/index.js
—— Obfuscator output ——
dev/publish-package.sh: line 339: --string-array: command not found
```

All obfuscation was failing after the tests passed, preventing package publication.

## Root Cause

The shell script `dev/publish-package.sh` contained inline comments (lines 337-338) within a multi-line command continuation:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/javascript-obfuscator "$file" \
  --output "$obf_tmp" \
  --compact true \
  ...
  --dead-code-injection-threshold 0.4 \
  # The following string array options have been grouped together for clarity.
  # Note: --string-array true was moved here from its previous position to improve logical grouping.
  --string-array true \
  ...
```

When the shell encounters a `#` comment character after a line continuation (`\`), it treats the comment as the end of the command. The subsequent line (`--string-array true \`) is then interpreted as a separate command, which fails because `--string-array` is not a valid shell command.

## Solution

Moved the inline comments from the middle of the command continuation to before the command starts:

```sh
# String array options grouped together for clarity (string-array moved from previous position)
./node_modules/.bin/javascript-obfuscator "$file" \
  --output "$obf_tmp" \
  --compact true \
  ...
  --dead-code-injection-threshold 0.4 \
  --string-array true \
  --string-array-threshold 0.75 \
  ...
```

## Files Changed

- **Modified**: `dev/publish-package.sh` - Moved comment from lines 337-338 to line 325, before the obfuscator command

## Testing

The fix was verified with:

1. ✅ Shell syntax validation: `sh -n dev/publish-package.sh`
2. ✅ Script help command: `sh dev/publish-package.sh --help`
3. ✅ Obfuscator command test with sample file

## Why This Fix Works

By moving the comment outside the command continuation:
- The shell correctly interprets all lines with backslashes as part of the same command
- All obfuscator options are properly passed to the javascript-obfuscator CLI
- The command executes without syntax errors

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar shell script issues:
1. Avoid placing comments in the middle of multi-line command continuations
2. Place comments before the command or at the end (without backslash continuation)
3. Use `sh -n <script>` to validate shell syntax before committing
4. Test shell scripts with simple execution before running full publishing pipeline
