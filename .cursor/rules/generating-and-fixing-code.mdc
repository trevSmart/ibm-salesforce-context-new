description: ⚠️ ASK USER TO RESTART MCP SERVER AFTER EVERY CHANGE (MANDATORY) ⚠️
alwaysApply: true
---

## BEFORE testing your code changes
- **Do not immediately test the new behavior** by executing the tool right after making code changes
- **Wait for MCP server restart** - The IDE needs to be restarted BY THE USER to pick up your code changes
- **Request confirmation** - Ask the user to notify you when they have restarted the MCP server
- **Then test** - Only execute the tool to test the new behavior after confirming the server has been restarted

### Testing Workflow
1. Complete code generation or modification
2. Inform the user that the MCP server needs to be restarted, ask him to restart to notify you when the restart is complete
3. Once the server is restarted, execute the tool to verify the new behavior

This ensures that code changes are properly loaded before testing and prevents errors from testing outdated code.
