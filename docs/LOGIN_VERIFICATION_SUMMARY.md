# Salesforce Org Login Verification - Summary

## Problem Statement
Confirm that the login to Salesforce org as part of the copilot environment initialization is working correctly.

## Investigation Results

### Initial State
The `dev/startEnvironment.sh` script had several critical issues that prevented proper Salesforce org authentication:

1. **Missing Environment Variable Exports**: The script obtained OAuth tokens but never exported `SF_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SF_INSTANCE_URL` to the environment
2. **Incorrect Variable Usage**: The script referenced `$SF_INSTANCE_URL` and `$SF_ORG_ALIAS` without setting them
3. **No Error Handling**: Failed OAuth requests were not detected
4. **No Success Indicator**: The `SF_AUTH_SUCCESS` flag was never set to `true`
5. **Brittle Dependencies**: The script assumed `jq` was installed without checking or providing fallback

### Root Cause
The `sf org login access-token` command requires the access token to be available via the `SF_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable, but the script was only extracting and displaying the token without exporting it.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes to `dev/startEnvironment.sh`

1. **Added Error Handling**
   - Added `set -e` to exit on errors
   - Check OAuth response for error messages
   - Set `SF_AUTH_SUCCESS=false` on failure

2. **Fixed Environment Variable Exports**
   ```bash
   export SF_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.access_token')
   export SF_INSTANCE_URL=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.instance_url')
   ```

3. **Added Fallback for jq**
   - Check if `jq` is available before using it
   - Fallback to `grep` and `cut` if `jq` is not installed
   - Only attempt to install `jq` if needed

4. **Set Default Alias**
   ```bash
   SF_ORG_ALIAS=${SF_ORG_ALIAS:-"copilot-env"}
   ```

5. **Added Success Indicator**
   ```bash
   export SF_AUTH_SUCCESS=true
   ```

6. **Enhanced Output**
   - Added informative messages at each step
   - Display truncated access token for security
   - Show instance URL for verification

### Test Suite Created

Created `test/dev/startEnvironment.test.sh` to validate:

1. ✅ SF_AUTH_SUCCESS is set to true
2. ✅ SF_ACCESS_TOKEN is properly exported
3. ✅ SF_INSTANCE_URL is properly exported
4. ✅ SF CLI successfully logs in
5. ✅ Can query Salesforce data

### Documentation Added

- `test/dev/README.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the test suite
- Updated script with inline comments explaining each step

## Verification Results

### Manual Testing
```bash
$ source dev/startEnvironment.sh
Authenticating with Salesforce...
Access Token obtained: 00DKN0000000yy5!AQYA...
Instance URL: https://caixabankcc--devservice.sandbox.my.salesforce.com
Logging in to Salesforce org with alias 'copilot-env'...
Successfully authorized u0190347@cc-caixabank.com.devservice with org ID 00DKN0000000yy52AA
Salesforce authentication successful!

$ echo $SF_AUTH_SUCCESS
true
```

### Automated Test Results
```
=== Validation Tests ===
✅ Test 1 PASSED: SF_AUTH_SUCCESS is set to true
✅ Test 2 PASSED: SF_ACCESS_TOKEN is set
✅ Test 3 PASSED: SF_INSTANCE_URL is set
✅ Test 4 PASSED: SF CLI is logged in
✅ Test 5 PASSED: Can query Salesforce data
=== All Tests Passed! ===
```

### SF CLI Verification
```bash
$ sf org display --json
{
  "status": 0,
  "result": {
    "id": "00DKN0000000yy52AA",
    "accessToken": "00DKN0000000yy5!AQYA...",
    "instanceUrl": "https://caixabankcc--devservice.sandbox.my.salesforce.com/",
    "username": "u0190347@cc-caixabank.com.devservice",
    "connectedStatus": "Connected",
    "alias": "copilot-env"
  }
}
```

### Data Query Verification
```bash
$ sf data query --query "SELECT Id, Name FROM User LIMIT 1" --json
{
  "status": 0,
  "result": {
    "records": [
      {
        "attributes": {
          "type": "User",
          "url": "/services/data/v65.0/sobjects/User/0051t000002tHHGAA2"
        },
        "Id": "0051t000002tHHGAA2",
        "Name": "Automated Process"
      }
    ],
    "totalSize": 1,
    "done": true
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

✅ **The Salesforce org login as part of the copilot environment initialization is now working correctly.**

### Key Achievements:
1. Fixed critical bugs in the startEnvironment.sh script
2. Added comprehensive error handling
3. Implemented fallback mechanisms for dependencies
4. Created automated validation tests
5. Verified end-to-end functionality
6. Documented the changes and test procedures

### Impact:
- Developers can now reliably authenticate with Salesforce orgs
- The `SF_AUTH_SUCCESS` environment variable correctly indicates authentication status
- The script works with or without `jq` installed
- Clear error messages help troubleshoot issues
- Automated tests ensure the functionality remains working
