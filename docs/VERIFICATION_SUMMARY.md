# Salesforce Org Authorization Verification - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The `copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow sets up Salesforce CLI and authorizes a Salesforce sandbox org as its default target org. This is critical for testing the MCP server. The task was to verify the authorization is working correctly.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Workflow Verification (`copilot-setup-steps.yml`)

Added a new dedicated step: **"Run comprehensive Salesforce org authorization verification"**

This step performs 5 comprehensive tests to verify the Salesforce org authorization:

1. **SF_AUTH_SUCCESS Environment Variable Test**
   - Verifies the authentication process completed successfully
   - Checks that `SF_AUTH_SUCCESS` is set to `true`

2. **SF_ACCESS_TOKEN Environment Variable Test**
   - Ensures the OAuth access token was obtained and exported
   - Displays the length of the token for verification (without exposing the actual token)

3. **SF_INSTANCE_URL Environment Variable Test**
   - Verifies the Salesforce instance URL was obtained and exported
   - Displays the actual instance URL

4. **SF CLI Authentication Status Test**
   - Confirms the Salesforce CLI is properly authenticated with the org
   - Executes `sf org display --json` to check CLI connection
   - Displays detailed org information:
     - Org ID
     - Username
     - Instance URL
     - Connected Status

5. **Data Query Capability Test**
   - Validates that authenticated org access allows data queries
   - Executes `sf data query` to retrieve a User record
   - Displays sample query result with User ID and Name

### Key Features

- **Conditional Execution**: Only runs if `SF_AUTH_SUCCESS == 'true'`
- **Detailed Output**: Each test provides clear pass/fail status with descriptive messages
- **Early Exit**: Workflow stops immediately if any test fails (exit code 1)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all critical aspects of Salesforce authorization
- **Consistent with Local Tests**: Matches the verification approach in `test/dev/startEnvironment.test.sh`

#### 2. Documentation (`docs/WORKFLOW_VERIFICATION.md`)

Created comprehensive documentation that includes:
- Overview of the verification process
- Detailed explanation of each test
- Expected output examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Integration details

## How It Works

The workflow follows this sequence:

```
1. Install Salesforce CLI globally
   ↓
2. Authenticate with Salesforce org (OAuth)
   ↓
3. Login and verify Salesforce org connection (SF CLI)
   ↓
4. Run comprehensive authorization verification ← NEW STEP
   ├─ Test 1: SF_AUTH_SUCCESS
   ├─ Test 2: SF_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ├─ Test 3: SF_INSTANCE_URL
   ├─ Test 4: SF CLI is logged in
   └─ Test 5: Can query Salesforce data
   ↓
5. Create Salesforce project (if all tests pass)
```

## Verification Approach

The verification step uses the same testing methodology as the existing `test/dev/startEnvironment.test.sh` script, ensuring consistency between:
- Local development environment setup
- CI/CD workflow environment setup

Both implement the same 5-test validation approach.

## Expected Workflow Output

When all tests pass, you will see:

```
=== Comprehensive Authorization Verification ===

✅ Test 1 PASSED: SF_AUTH_SUCCESS is set to true
✅ Test 2 PASSED: SF_ACCESS_TOKEN is set (length: 132)
✅ Test 3 PASSED: SF_INSTANCE_URL is set (https://example.salesforce.com)
✅ Test 4 PASSED: SF CLI is logged in
Org details:
  Org ID: 00DKN0000000yy5
  Username: user@example.com
  Instance URL: https://example.salesforce.com
  Connected Status: Connected
✅ Test 5 PASSED: Can query Salesforce data
Sample query result:
  User ID: 0051t000002tHHG
  User Name: Automated Process

=== All Authorization Verification Tests Passed! ===
```

## Testing the Changes

To test the changes:

1. **Trigger the workflow manually**:
   - Go to GitHub Actions in the repository
   - Select "Copilot Setup Steps" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select the branch with these changes

2. **Or push changes to this workflow file**:
   - The workflow automatically runs on push/PR to `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`

3. **Review the workflow logs**:
   - Check the "Run comprehensive Salesforce org authorization verification" step
   - Verify all 5 tests show ✅ PASSED status
   - Review the detailed output for each test

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Verification**: All aspects of Salesforce authorization are tested
2. **Early Detection**: Problems are caught immediately after authentication
3. **Clear Diagnostics**: Detailed output helps troubleshoot issues quickly
4. **Consistency**: Same verification approach used in local and CI/CD environments
5. **Fail-Fast**: Workflow stops immediately if authorization fails, saving time
6. **Security**: Access tokens are not displayed in logs (only their length)

## Files Changed

1. `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` - Added comprehensive verification step
2. `docs/WORKFLOW_VERIFICATION.md` - New documentation file
3. `docs/VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Conclusion

✅ **The Salesforce org authorization in the `copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow now has comprehensive verification.**

The new verification step ensures that:
- OAuth authentication completes successfully
- Required environment variables are properly set
- Salesforce CLI can authenticate with the org
- The org is accessible and can be queried

This provides confidence that the MCP server can be properly tested in the GitHub Actions environment.
